        - Camera-Lidar-Radar Fusion Model
          - Low-Level Latent Fusion Model for Multi-view camera, LiDARs, and RADARs to solve 3D Detection and Lane Segmentation.
          - Implemented TensorRT plugins for unsupported operation. CUDA accelarations for parallelizable operations. Used C++, CUDA, TensorRT, PyTorch.
        - Monocular 3D Detection
          - Developed a 3D Object Detection model on monocular images. Developed TensorRT engine and inference in C++, CUDA.
          - Deployed on the test vehicle achieving 3x inference speedup after quantization.
        - Lidar based 3D Detection
          - Deployed LiDAR-only model for 3D detection. Developed TensorRT engine resulting in 24 FPS inference speed on the test vehicle.
        - Face and Number Plate Detection and Blurring Developyed and deployed the model at 100FPS on test vehicle.
