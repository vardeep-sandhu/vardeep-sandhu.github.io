I am a Perception Engineer specializing in autonomous driving based in Germany. With expertise in Python, C++, CUDA, 3D computer vision, ROS2, TensorRT, Sensor Synchronisation, and calibration, I develop cutting-edge solutions for safe and efficient autonomous vehicles. 

I leverage my programming skills to create robust algorithms and extract meaningful information from sensor data using advanced 3D computer vision techniques.

Additionally, I utilize ROS2 for seamless integration and communication within autonomous systems. With TensorRT, I optimize deep learning models for real-time inference on embedded platforms. I also excel in sensor synchronization and calibration to ensure accurate sensor fusion.
